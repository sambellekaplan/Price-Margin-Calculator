## Objective

The Price Margin Calculator program is designed to help determine a fair price point on a product depending on the margin. The primary focus is to help retailers determine at which margin they should sell their products and/ or services. It calculates the original margin it falls at, then increases the margin by 3%, 5% and 10%.

## Skills Learned

- Basic Python Programming (Input handling, data type conversion, formatted output)
- Mathematical Calculations (Basic arithmetic operations, percentage calculations, margin calculations)
- Logical Thinking and Problem Solving (Price adjustment calculations, target margin calculations)
- Clean Coding (formatting and presentation, code structure, code documentation)
